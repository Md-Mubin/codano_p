                            <p>The web development landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, with artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a powerful force reshaping how websites and applications are designed, built, and maintained. Far from being a futuristic concept, AI has become an integral part of the modern developer's toolkit, streamlining workflows and enabling capabilities that were once considered impossible.</p>

                            <p>This article explores how AI is revolutionizing web development, the key technologies driving this change, and practical ways developers and businesses can leverage these tools to create better digital experiences.</p>

                            <h2>How AI is Transforming Web Development</h2>

                            <h3>Design and Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>Traditional design processes are being reimagined through AI-powered tools:</p>

                            <h4>AI-Assisted Design Generation</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Systems like Midjourney and DALL-E can generate custom imagery based on text prompts</li>
                                <li>Tools like Visly and Builder.io can suggest entire layouts based on basic requirements</li>
                                <li>Color scheme generators use AI to create harmonious palettes aligned with brand guidelines</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Automated Prototyping</h4>
                            <ul>
